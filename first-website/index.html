  <p>The hand has become <em>increasingly</em> less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>  It has only gotten easier to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.
  <hr>
  <p>This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and <small>present context</small> of the web.</p>

  <p>We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an <em class="odd"><strong>important</strong></em> creative space.</p>
